How to deploy to surge:
-npm run build
-cd into the dist directory 
-surge --domain ng-budget.surge.sh

Everyday:
-Always have the unit tests running
-Deploy at the end of each session assuming unit tests aren't breaking 
and lint isn't failing.

Plan:
-Implement bar graph 
  -Render the same bar graph using hardcodeed
  d3 code. 
  -Modify the data to be dynamically generated.
    -there has to be a bunch of calculations 
    based on the array values. 
  -Have the bar graph handle displaying 
  2 or 3 bars based on the data.




-When you add a transaction and then delete it
the pie graph will not remove the nodes from 
the legend 
-We have duplicate svg code being added 
-if you get 0s for the pie graph don't show the legend for it and don't show 
the 0 for it. 
-enable the ability to use the keyboard to undo a transaction.  Maybe escape 
 or have it focus on the snackbar undo.  
-Whenever you expand category transactions it resets your focus to beginning of
 the list of categories.  Maybe you can have it refocus based on the categoryId 
 in the url. 
-implement exporting and importing budgets.
-We need to also be able to view the start and end dates of a budget as quick reference. 
-write e2e tests 

-remove heading that shows budget totals 
-group the end to end tests in a logical manner
-create budget page needs a back button


-write unit tests for side effects
-unit test actions creator service 
-prevent navigating to earlier months than begin date.  Same 
with end date. 
-prevent going ahead to months that are in the future. 
-Use constants for your action types
-write unit tests for dumb components
-need to write a ton of documentation



Animate:
-graphs should animate using d3
-use fade in animation for changing budgets and going from 
one month to the next month
-when viewing transactions for a category have it come up from
the bottom.  Alternatively fade in animation is fine too
-when viewing create new budget screen fade in animation.

-maybe in the future you can have 3 media query breakpoints:
  -desktop: would show both side navs
  -tablet: would only show the reporting nav 
  -phone: would show no navs


-Have the router prevent you from going to the 
main budget page if you haven't created a budget 
yet.  
-Explore adding an interface to the action in the reducers 

-make keyboard accessible
-make screenreader accessible

-fix linting errors 
-Have travisci or circleci run protractor tests and unit tests before it deploys
 using surge.
-prevent writing to master (require doing PRs to master)
-implement optimistic concurrency.  This will work well since you are generating
 the ids on the client side. 
-handle logging (maybe there's a few logging service, or at least free bug tracking)
-router edge cases (invalid month, year in the url) 
-use css resets
-use consistent font throughout the app. 
-fix double scrollbar issue 
-refactor category component to take in the whole object rather than passing 
sub properties off of the whole object. 
-cool feature: have the ability to move a transaction to a previous or next month.
So just add <, > buttons per row that do this.
