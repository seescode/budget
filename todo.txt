How to deploy to surge:
-cd into the dist directory 
-surge --domain ng-budget.surge.sh



-need to revisit my pie data setup.  I don't think using angular2 
to rerender the data makes any sense.  You're going to have to do
it the d3 way with the enter, update, exit crap.

pie 
-Add labels to each slice of the pie.  Have the label say the 
 amount in dollars

-Bind to the real data   
  -update the ngrx selectors 
-Animate!  
  -any time you add a new transaction have it update

-create a new component that encapsulate the pie chart. 
Basically the pie chart should take in the data which 
is going to be an array of this object: 
{
  color, text
}
It should also take in an event emitter as the input.  
This way when a next transaction is added we tell the 
pie chart to animate.
 -it should also take in width and height.  




-create 2 d3 pie charts: one for total budget and the other 
one for monthly budget which would also include in it the 
surplus.  You could also get fancy with the total budget 
pie chart for each month to have a unique color.

-we should have a small button that switches the view of 
the d3 pie charts.  Expanded or collapsed.  Collapsed would 
be a simple bar with colors.  No explanations at all.  



-make the header sticky
-must make the page reach the bottom 

-add a snackbar for whenever you add a transaction.  You should be 
able to quickly undo a transaction from this. 


-Add headings to the pie charts. 



-maybe in the future you can have 3 media query breakpoints:
  -desktop: would show both side navs
  -tablet: would only show the reporting nav 
  -phone: would show no navs


-when clicking on the category list button it should go to a new 
page.  Maybe you can enable some type of nice transition whenever
you go to a new page.    
-when clicking on the create new budget button it should go to 
a new page.  Add a cool transition.    
-the new category button needs to be moved elsewhere.  Since you 
will enable scrolling this new category will not be very accessible. 
Either move it to the left hand side bar or put it on the top
navigation bar.

-need to spend some time learning material UI
  -watch a video 
  -do themes give you css related to fonts and link colors?


-unit test actions creator service 
-prevent navigating to earlier months than begin date.  Same 
with end date. 
-prevent going ahead to months that are in the future. 
-research how to do angular2 forms.
-Use constants for your action types

-Have the router prevent you from going to the 
main budget page if you haven't created a budget 
yet.  
-Explore adding an interface to the action in the reducers 
-write unit tests for reducers 
-write unit tests for dumb components
-write end to end tests instead of smart component unit tests 

-make keyboard accessible
-make screenreader accessible

-fix linting errors 
-implement exporting and importing budgets 
-create protractor tests that create a budget from scratch and then creates
 transactions.  It verifies that the calculated values are correct at the top.
 Then destroys the budget.  
-Have travisci or circleci run protractor tests and unit tests before it deploys
 using surge.
-prevent writing to master (require doing PRs to master)
-implement optimistic concurrency.  This will work well since you are generating
 the ids on the client side. 
-handle logging (maybe there's a few logging service, or at least free bug tracking)
-router edge cases (invalid month, year in the url)
